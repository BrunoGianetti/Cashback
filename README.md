# Welcome to my second Python Project - Cashback.

Here you can see a code that I apply for offer discounts to build customer loyalty.

## How it work

I use a while estructure to create a menu with three options.

1) Calculating receipts
2) Rescue discount
3) Instructions

Inside options, we can see variables, conditionals, math expressions, counters and accumulators.

## How I use it in my job

Customers ride with me and collect receipts. I calculate all those values receipts and send two values: long ride or short ride. If they want recue the discount, I calc a new ride less the discount.
